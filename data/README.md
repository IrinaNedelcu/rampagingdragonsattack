# Data Used in this Project

This directory contains data files used in this project, as well as 
some data dictionaries that explain where data can be downloaded, which columns 
were downloaded and what they mean.

## Contributing data
Small data files can be shared here, however it is preferable to upload them to 
[data.world](www.data.world) in the [residential educational segregation project](https://data.world/res-edu-seg/residential-educational-segregation). 
After you upload the data there, please provide a markdown file in this folder with the 
following information:
* the file name
* the origin of the data (with link)
* the date the data was downloaded
* any details about how the download was specified (e.g. if specific columns were requested)
* a list of all (relevant) columns in the table, and their meaning


1) create a new file or edit existing file
2) run 'git status'
3) then run 'git add . --all'  <- this adds the new changes you made
4) then run "git commit -m 'add your commit message'" <- this prepares the changes you've made to be ready to push
5) Finally, run 'git push'
